A Discord bot

Thanks to IT Connected for making this tutorial: https://youtu.be/aFI1SItR8tg


Usage:

0. You need to have the discord.py library installed to use this.
1. Invite the bot to your server
2. Add your Discord bot token into the code (you can get it from here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)
3. Start the bot using command line or the .bat file

The help and rotating "Playing" files are all added by default, the quote list is added when the "addquote" command is used.
